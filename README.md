This is the code repository for [ROS 2 from Scratch](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/ros-2-from-scratch-9781835881415), published by Packt.

**Get started with ROS 2 and create robotics applications with Python and C++**

## What is this book about?
Learning Robot Operating System (ROS) can be hard as online resources for creating new software for robots are rare, not well organized, and not targeted toward beginners. This book teaches you all basics you need to create your own ROS 2 apps.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand what ROS 2 is, when to use it, and how to use it
* Write ROS 2 programs using nodes, topics, services, actions, and custom interfaces
* Scale your application with parameters and launch files
* Get a complete overview of how TFs work for any ROS-powered robot
* Create a robot model (with URDF) and visualize TFs on RViz
* Adapt the URDF to spawn and control your robot in the Gazebo simulator

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, ch11.

The code will look like the following:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for engineers, researchers, teachers, students, and hobbyists eager to learn ROS 2 from scratch and build real-world robotics applications efficiently. If youâ€™re struggling to get started with ROS 2 or find existing tutorials overwhelming, then this book is for you. This book teaches you all the basics you need to create your own ROS 2 apps, without prior ROS knowledge. Basic Linux command line and Python programming skills (C++ optional for following the C++ code examples) are necessary.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).
### Software and Hardware List
| Software required | OS required |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| ROS 2 Jazzy | Ubuntu 24.04 |
